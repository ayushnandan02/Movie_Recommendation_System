## Features

- User-based and item-based collaborative filtering
- Content-based recommendation algorithm
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Interactive user interface
- Visualization of recommendations and user data
- Scalable architecture for large datasets

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (or other UI framework)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayushnandan02/Movie_Recommendation_System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Movie_Recommendation_System
    ```
3. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset (see `data/` directory for examples).
2. Run the main application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. Access the user interface (if available) to interact with the movie recommendation system.
